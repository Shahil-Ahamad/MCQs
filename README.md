# Backend Project

This project serves as the backend for your application, built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. It supports authentication, secure password hashing, and data validation.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using `bcryptjs` to prevent plain text storage.
- **Input Validation**: Input validation is handled using `zod` to ensure data integrity.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to manage API access from different domains.
- **Environment Management**: Sensitive information and configuration are stored securely in `.env` files using the `dotenv` package.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` as specified in the `package.json` file.

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your environment variables. An example `.env` file might look like this:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   Be sure to replace `your_jwt_secret` with a secret key for signing JWTs.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `package.json`:

| Command         | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript files into JavaScript.       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts the development server with live reload. |
| `npm start`     | Builds the project and starts the production server. |

### Development Server

To run the server in development mode with live reload, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build and Start

To build the project and start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile your TypeScript files and then start the application.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Express**: A web framework for building APIs in Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript with type safety.
- **bcryptjs**: A library for hashing passwords securely.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **zod**: A schema validation library to ensure that incoming data matches expected formats.
- **cookie-parser**: To parse cookies sent by the client in HTTP requests.
- **CORS**: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on APIs.
